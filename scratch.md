# New idea 08 March 2021

I would like to build a template with laravel and THEN create a template from the app. For example, the tool could scan my app, determine the packages I installed (php/npm, etc) and use that to create the skeleton of the template. As well, it could scaffold out views, controllers, tests, etc.
